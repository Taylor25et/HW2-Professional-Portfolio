# HW2-Professional-Portfolio
Navbar: My portfolio has a navbar at the top of the screen so that the viewer can click down to different sections of my website. This part took me the most time to setup. I looked a lot of different examples, but I liked the box-shadowing and hover feature that it has. 

Home Section: I wasn’t sure what to title the Website but since we will be revisiting this throughout the course, I have a working title of “Taylor Thompson / Digital Portfolio”.
I saw that some people had ‘hire me’ buttons, although I got the hover option working for this portion and the shading looks the way I’d like it to I was having trouble setting up the alert. We are currently learning Java Script in class. I looked at example online of ways to create different alerts and popups through CSS+HTML but I think the JavaScript option looks the most how I would like it to. So once we get more familiar with JS I will add a function to my Hire Me button.

About Section: I wasn’t sure what to put here yet since I don’t have enough Web experience to start marketing myself. This will get updated further into the course since I plan to be a backend developer. I had issues creating space directly after my About Section. 

Portfolio Section: Again, I didn’t have anything to add here yet since this is my fourth week in the class and my second homework assignment. I’m hoping throughout the course this can get added to. For now, the photos are meant to be placeholders for projects to come. I’d like the images to have links to my projects so that when I click on them people can view my work

Services Section: This part took the second most amount of time. I was trying to get a fading effect using just CSS+HTML. It doesn’t look the way I’d like it to so I might take it out later or change it once we get more into JS. The transition might be the issue, but I would need to work with a tutor on this one at some point because mine did not turn out how the example showed up. I currently don’t have any Services setup so the information here will need to get updated.

Contact Section: I’m working on linking these boxes so that people can enter their info so that I can reach out to them. I don’t want to but my contact info up online. I think it is more professional when there is a section for the client to send in their info instead. Videos on how to get this linking to work I think will also be working with JS just like the ‘Hire me’ button. I think this will end up taking the most time
